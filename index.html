                    <p>Jazz began as a very American art form starting in the late 1800s. However it soon spread across the world. The history of jazz in japan started in the 1910s when luxury liners crossed the Pacific. They brought orchestras who learned early foxtrot music. In addition, America had colonized many East Asian countries and the Philippines were a key avenue for jazz to spread to Japan.</p>
                    <p>The first time Japan heard of the word jazz was in a movie called Tokyo March. This idea of having dance halls and people buying tickets to dance with a paid partner appealed to the public. It then became the music of young upper-middle-class people and as more record companies sold music, it become incredibly popular.</p>
                    <p>However World War II came and Japan became the enemy. This halted jazz popularity a bit, but the end of the war brought an even bigger demand. Thousands of American troops were stationed in Japan and they craved live music. There weren't enough American musicians so they hired Japanese musicians and gave them jazz to play. See below for a photo of U.S. servicemen and their Japanese partners dancing to jazz tunes</p>
                    <p><img src = "img/ww2jazzz.jpg"></p>
                    <p>After the American occupation of Japan, Japanese jazz musicians started to make a big impression on U.S. audiences. Toshiko Akiyoshi is one of the most famous bandleaders from Japan and even received a NEA Jazz Masters award, the highest recognition for jazz artistry. Jazz was seen as Western in Japan and so Japanese people loved it. Yet like all music appropriation, it came with criticism. However, Japanese jazz musicians would acknowledge they did not own the music and would admit they imitated Western musicians, but would nevertheless practice and prove everyone wrong.</p>

                    <p class="text-faded">Since the WWII, jazz in Japan has continued to flourish and is incredibly popular with youth and the middle class. Tokyo is one of the most notorious incubators for jazz with hundred of jazz clubs and pumping out incredible musicians as well as big jazz festivals</p>
                    <img src = "img/cottonclub.jpg"><figcaption>Cotton Jazz Club in Tokyo</figcaption><br>
                    <p class="text-faded">This popularity can be seen in the youth. I had the pleasure of talking with two Tokyo University students who both wanted to be full time jazz musicians. Although their English isn't the best, they convey what most students and people think about jazz. Just hearing their words, it seems jazz is more popular in Japan than even in America where it originally came from. Here are their quotes.</p>
                    <img src = "img/wataru.jpg" align="left" height = "320px" width = "240px" hspace="20"><br><br><br>
                    <p class = "text-faded" align = "right">"I play the jazz in session. Every great musicians play the jazz as the job. But I play the jazz to free or wanna fun. So many time do it yourself to yourself. my friend working in jazz bar. And play the guitar. some people listening to jazz, some people tasting the alcohol. Many time,open at the big jazz festival in Japan. Many people join! Many professional also amateur.every one love! Inconspicuous everyday,but I think, many people love the jazz and the all music!"</p>

                    <p class = "text-faded" align = "left">"I think Jazz music is very important. It can take in my play. Swing beats is very difficult so I practice every day,  every day , every day and every day !!!
                    To be frank, Jazz isnt prevalent especialy among youth. So they have to listen to Jazz."</p><br><br><br><br>
                    <p class = "text-faded">In addition, jazz has crept into every type of art form in Japan! The most famous example is anime. Anime is an incredibly respected and popular art form and when the top anime in Japan has jazz music, it shows just how deep jazz has traveled.</p>
                    <p class = "text-faded">The best example of this is "Cowboy Bebop". It is currently ranked 3rd for most popular anime according to Anime News Network. The soundtrack contains famous big band jazz tunes. Closely after at rank 14 is my favorite anime, Samurai Champloo whose track was created by the most famous jazz hop musician Nujabes. You can find examples of these songs in Examples of Japanese Jazz</p>

                    <hr class="primary">
                    <p>Jazz in Japan showcases various ways how music travels. Everything from luxury liners to colonization to war to westernization all played a part. The fact that jazz blew up so big in Japan raises more questions.It is one thing for music to travel as an exotic showcase of a foreign culture, but another for the country to engrain it so deeply. Definitely questions of authenticity come to play. Is Japanese jazz just as good? Is it even better? Does it matter who plays the music if it still has the same result? Being a Japanese jazz musician myself, I have to ask these types of questions. Jazz is not originally my culture's music, but seeing at how popular it has become, is jazz now part of me?</p>
